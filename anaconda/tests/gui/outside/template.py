# This code template ends up being the special suite.py file referred to in the
# Creator.makeSuite documentation.  It lives in the suite disk image and is
# automatically started by the live CD on boot (see the kickstart file for where
# this happens).  Basically, this is responsible for doing everything inside the
# VM - it runs the test suite, figures out whether it failed or not, puts results
# in place, and reboots.
